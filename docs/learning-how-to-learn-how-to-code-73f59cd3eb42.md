## 在这一行，学习是一个美丽的常数。

## 想象一下。

就编码而言，这是相当普通的一周…我在周中启动了一个仪表板站点的 poc/demo，目前我正在处理服务器部署问题*这是我本周学到的一些东西:

```
- How to make a new file on a terminal in windows.
- What is pyenv and how to use it.
- Relearn pyplot
- How to load JSON data in pyplot.
- How to theme pyplot charts.
- How to use pyplot scatter charts with a dataframe index.
- How to SSH into my new server.
- How to re-boot a capRover instance.
- How to integrate tabulate.js with vue.
- How to use tabulate.js.
- How to integrate a vue component with jquery and select a table.
- How to allow table data downloads from a browser.
- How to use a cocktail shaker....for a zoom meeting :)
- How to flash the bios from my main computer after a failed upgrade.** Solved Saturday evening by learning how to write dockerfiles with the right python distribution and some tweaks.
* - These are just the ones I can remember, my browser history reminds me I visited [**Stackoverflow**](https://stackoverflow.com) on at least ~160 different times to ask for small and not so small things.
```

## 学习是一个持续的过程。

如果你是一个经验丰富的程序员或软件开发人员，我可能不需要提醒你这一点，如果你是编码新手，你可能想坐下来听我将要告诉你的事情。

**你将被期望在没有指导的情况下学习、发现或修复新的和旧的东西，并在生产中应用所述知识。每一个。单身。说吧。它从未停止。**

## 你可能会喜欢上它。

我知道，学习让你保持警觉，在适当的情况下会变得很上瘾；不幸的是，这需要一些时间来享受学习一个新的图书馆，同时还有一个不可能的截止日期，一个老板/客户盯着你，个人分心以及任务失败的真正后果，最好的情况下可能是一次尴尬的谈话，最坏的情况下你会因为不能学习而被解雇。🤕

## 但是为什么呢？

如果你想一想，软件/代码是一种通用语言，用来制造新的虚拟事物，任何人都可以用电脑来获取这种语言的知识，有点像魔法。所以现在每个人都在不断地创造新的东西，以新的/更好的/更快的方式创造新的东西，这似乎是一个永无止境的循环。

然后你就投入到这一连串的活动中，学习是入门和保持相关性的代价…

```
**Self directed vs guided learning (ie CS Mayors, coding courses)**I am a self taught software developer and usually work with CS ( Computer Science ) mayors and codecamp graduates, the question you might have is who is better prepared to learn ?The answer I think is neither, we both need to constantly learn and adapt, not having a CS Mayor does not mean you wont be able to learn how to code proficiently and conversely having a CS Mayor or related education does not mean you will not have to learn anything else again or that you have some unsurmountable advantage.*( A real unsurmountable advantage for university graduates vs self learners might be the connections/relationships made there but this is unrelated to actually writing any software though.)*In any case I hope the following helps you regardless of where you are coming from and helps you learn faster.
```

## 从何说起。

我很想说在任何地方，因为你总是会重复你的步骤，一遍又一遍地重新学习基础知识，你也需要快速忘记事情，因为现在推荐的是新版本的 **X** : `**X.3.2**`，你已经学习了`**X.2.1.**` **然而对于一些主题来说，学习一些半固定的主题(数据结构、算法、模式等)是值得的。)而这正是 CS 市长们拥有结构化课程优势的地方。**

我个人更喜欢一些具体的切入点，然后快速实验…

```
Let me divide topics into a few layers/cases as to make better recommendations:**- You know nothing:** Here is where I think a good introductorycourse on CS concepts ( *which I didn't take when I started and sometimes regret* ) will help you the most, well worth some money if you can afford it, just to be clear you might not learn much ( *practically* ) but rather be primed and will have a reference point for the future.**- You are broke:** Having no money complicates things at this stage because there simply aren't any good/permanent/free online resources to get you started, but what there are a books and libraries which should give you all the basics for little to no money.**- New Language:** Not gonna lie, this is rough and only gets marginally better with experience, on-boarding is all over the place for languages ( *it's usually bad* ), so if the online reference on the language makes no sense you might need to research on a good ( *and probably expensive* ) book or course. If you can't find or afford one ( *or a couple* ) your best bet are online forums and chats which usually have a newbie channel or section, but you will need to be patient.***Honorable mention:*** *Youtube has plenty of free videos that can help you get started, the quality is all over the place and I find them hard to follow vs regular text, but your milage may be better.* 
**- New Framework/library/tool:** Here the starting documentation/on-boarding is usually better and there are good starting resources...then they plummet/disappear and you are left on your own, there's usually an API or language reference that was written by an autodoc program and well it sucks, mainly because it lacks context and/or was written from an experience standpoint that doesn't match yours but as starting/reference points these work well. **- New complex thing:** You are on your own, there are no roads, signs or maps ( else it wouldn't be new ), yet we are asked to make these things every other day. Not entirely sure if there is one or many ways to get started here but I usually research and start from where others left off as to not waste time reinventing the wheel; I also need to be careful not to spend too much time here, then it's off to experimentation ( small ) and documenting, look at [design thinking (**the process**)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_thinking) for a structured and tried approach. 
```

好了，接下来要做的就是开始学习，这里是我对不同类型的学习以及何时/如何使用它们的一些一般性观察…

## 艰难地学习，尝试、失败、失败、再失败，然后坚持下去。

循环通常是这样的，你阅读甚至跟随一两个新东西的指南，然后尝试你自己版本的东西，通常是指南的一个小变化，它不起作用，然后你尝试更多的东西，没有用。这足以让你沮丧，甚至在多年后还会焦虑，并怀疑这种编码的东西是否适合你。

深呼吸，让我试着解释发生了什么以及如何解决。

```
If you look at my list of things I learned this week, you might have noticed the ***** one that was solved Saturday, that one involved modifying a simple text file and took roughly 40-50 or so different tries over maybe 4 hours, each try involved changing a few characters.What I am trying to get at here is that **coding is fundamentally a conversation between 2 very different entities, the computer wants very precise instructions and is flawless, we usually give very imprecise commands and make tons of mistakes.** While languages are still evolving to be more human friendly, for now you need to modify your behavior because the computer ain't changing for you 💔
```

为了解决这类问题，你需要保持事情小、有序和可测试，不幸的是说起来容易做起来难，linters 和单元测试可能会帮助你(特别是在组织中)，但是当你独自开始一件新的事情时，一个通用的过程可以更好地为你服务，这里是我的…

```
- Divide the issue or thing you are a building/learning into as many smaller units or parts as you can imagine.- Try each one separately and troubleshoot each individual process independently.- Integrate the components one by one. - Test the whole thing.If you find out there were architectural/design problems, go back to step one.
```

## 何时寻求外部帮助？

所以你尝试了一个新的代码行，得到一个错误消息或者得到一个不正确的结果。在你马上去谷歌搜索之前，我建议你自己尝试一些东西(*任何东西*)，仔细阅读错误信息或写下不正确的结果。

这是学习的一个关键部分:在得到解决方案之前不把问题合理化会增加你重复它的机会，不把它标记为重要(通过尝试和失败)会减少你在未来记住它的机会。

```
**Example:**def randomfunction(arg)
    print(‘Hello World’)**>>> Error message:**File "/Users/keno/Desktop/Dev/example.py", line 1
    def randomfunction(arg)
                          ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax I want a function that prints Hello World, but nothing is happening and I get an obscure error message, it does tell me something is wrong with the syntax at the end of the function. I try adding a semicolon ( ; ) and I still get the same error, so that's not it, ok, let's ask the internet...[def (arg)   ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&sxsrf=ALeKk024wmJTK1KDxicY1hFW7fURM972Pg%3A1591208349460&ei=nenXXuDKG4Ot0PEPhPi2qAY&q=def+%28arg%29+++%5E+SyntaxError%3A+invalid+syntax&oq=def+%28arg%29+++%5E+SyntaxError%3A+invalid+syntax&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIFCAAQzQIyBQgAEM0CMgUIABDNAjIFCAAQzQIyBQgAEM0COgQIABBHUN_eBFj17gRg6fAEaABwAXgAgAHfAYgB0RCSAQYwLjEzLjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwigjbuDoebpAhWDFjQIHQS8DWUQ4dUDCAs&uact=5)*Note that I tried to remove anything that is not specific to my case.***Solution:**I notice that all the functions end up with ( **:** ), maybe that's it, I try again and the error is gone! But there's nothing being printed, do I need to do anything else ? Ohh yeah I need to call the function:randomfunction()**>> New message error:** TypeError: randomfunction() missing 1 required positional argument: 'arg'**Solution:**Now it's telling me I don't have an argument, but I don't need any arguments, what if I remove them from the function...def randomfunction():
    print('Hello World')randomfunction()>>> **Hello World**So functions need a colon ( **: )** you need to call them and if you don't need arguments don't include them in your function definition... got it.
```

这是你学习语言的基本方法，但是学习编码还有更多，这里有一些额外的策略:

## 只是一点点自信和有人倾诉。

通常，当我帮助别人解决问题时，我自己也不知道解决方法，但在一个简短的来回之后，当问题被描述给我时，它通常会像变魔术一样得到解决，有人，甚至是一个无生命的物体或宠物，你可以解释你的问题，通常让你从不同的角度看待问题，有信心尝试新的东西并提出解决方案。

我的哑巴学习伙伴。

## 学会掌握并获得自信，写一篇文章，教一个人。

据说，教学或写文章会让你处于一种不同的心境，并帮助你巩固概念。它还有一个额外的好处，就是成为你自己的个人文档，这让我想到了下一个建议…

## 写下来。

根据项目的不同，我通常会拿出一个小脚本或一套笔记，每天查阅，直到我记住它们，这些笔记最终会成为一篇文章的一部分或存档，记录你的学习也是一个很好的做法，它可以像计算或列出你学习时访问的资源一样简单。

## 学会生存。

很难说，你最终会通过从 SO([**Stack Overflow**](https://stackoverflow.com))或一些其他在线资源复制粘贴来解决问题，这没有什么不好意思的，但你确实需要能够将你的问题转移和翻译到 SO 中被询问的问题，有时会筛选一些不相关的问题和答案，加上它不太欢迎新用户。

我开始依赖的另一项生存技能是在 Github repos 上进行深度挖掘，特别是搜索过去的问题并快速进入代码库。你的问题可能太新了，以至于它是一个正在积极处理的 bug 或问题，或者已经解决了，但是还没有解决。

```
**Asking questions to strangers…**I see asking question on forums, reddit, StackOverflow and finally the Github Repo (in this order) as measures of last resort or increased desperation. Whats more, most of the time I usually end up answering my own questions.It does help because as mentioned re-stating your problem usually unclogs your mental machinery and brings forth clarity or a new solution but don't expect a quick or effective answer and be prepared to deal with some miscommunications, so be patient and nice. 
```

我真诚地希望这能有所帮助，如果我错过了什么，请在评论中告诉我。

感谢阅读！
